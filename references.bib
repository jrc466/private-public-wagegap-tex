A regressão quantílica constatou um comportamento crescente do hiato, ao passo que a Decomposição Quantílica evidenciou que os trabalhadores dos quantis mais próximos à mediana possuem um maior prêmio salarial, sendo até mesmo negativo no último quantil.},

	title = {({Mis}){Allocation} {Effects} of an {Overpaid} {Public} {Sector}},
	abstract = {In an economy in which the public sector is productive and factor inputs are rewarded according to their marginal productivity in both the public and the private sectors, the presence of a large government does not generate necessarily any allocation problem. When the provision of public infrastructure is below its optimal scale, then an increase in the size of the government can lead to an increase in total factor productivity (TFP). There is, however, a large body of evidence showing that for many countries the structure of wages and pensions and the labor law legislation are different for public and private employees. Such differences affect the occupational decision of agents and might generate some type of misallocation in the economy. We develop an equilibrium model with endogenous occupational choice, heterogeneous agents and imperfect enforcement to study the implications of an overpaid public sector. The model is estimated to be consistent with micro and macro evidence for Brazil and our counterfactual exercises show that public-private earnings premium can generate important allocation effects and sizeable productivity losses.},

	abstract = {This paper analyzes the placement in the private sector of a subset of Brazilian public-sector employees. This group left public employment in the mid-1990’s through a voluntary dismissal program. This paper contrasts their wages before and after quitting the public sector, and compares both sets of wages to public and private sector wages for similar workers. We find that participants in this voluntary dismissal program suffered a significant reduction in average wage and an increase in wage dispersion. We test whether the reduction in average wage and the increase in wage dispersion is the expected outcome once one controls for observed characteristics, by means of counterfactual simulations. We also examine the importance of stigma effects and difficulties of private sector absorption due to specific human capital accumulation. A summary of new estimation procedures and results to be incorporated in the next version of the paper are included at the end of the paper, after the appendix.},

	abstract = {Counterfactual distributions are important ingredients for policy analysis and decomposition analysis in empirical economics. In this article, we develop modeling and inference tools for counterfactual distributions based on regression methods. The counterfactual scenarios that we consider consist of ceteris paribus changes in either the distribution of covariates related to the outcome of interest or the conditional distribution of the outcome given covariates. For either of these scenarios, we derive joint functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for regression-based estimators of the status quo and counterfactual outcome distributions. These results allow us to construct simultaneous confidence sets for function-valued effects of the counterfactual changes, including the effects on the entire distribution and quantile functions of the outcome as well as on related functionals. These confidence sets can be used to test functional hypotheses such as no-effect, positive effect, or stochastic dominance. Our theory applies to general counterfactual changes and covers the main regression methods including classical, quantile, duration, and distribution regressions. We illustrate the results with an empirical application to wage decompositions using data for the United States. As a part of developing the main results, we introduce distribution regression as a comprehensive and flexible tool for modeling and estimating the entire conditional distribution. We show that distribution regression encompasses the Cox duration regression and represents a useful alternative to quantile regression. We establish functional central limit theorems and bootstrap validity results for the empirical distribution regression process and various related functionals.},

The estimate is based on counterfactual simulations and the contribution to inequality on a factor decomposition of the Gini coefficient. Data comes from the Brazilian National Household Survey PNAD 2009. The differential corresponds approximately to 17\% of the wage bill of workers in the public sector, is regressive and highly concentrated. However, because it amounts to a small share of the total income (1\%) its contribution to the total inequality is of 3\%. The sector composition effects on inequality are times higher than the segmentation (price) effects. These conclusions are robust to changes in the definition of the sectors and to different estimation techniques.},

We estimate wage distributions in the presence of covariates separately for men and women in the public and in the private sectors, and we take advantage of the longitudinal structure of the data to control for selection. We ﬁnd a positive public wage premium for men and women even after accounting for characteristics and endogenous selection; the observed average gap in hourly wages of 35 log points is reduced to 20 when accounting for observed characteristics, and to 10 once endogenous selection is also taken into consideration. We also ﬁnd substantial variation in the public premium along the wage distribution once observed characteristics are accounted for. This variation, however, is offset by opposite patterns of selection into the public sector: while we observe positive selection into the public sector at the bottom of the wage distribution, workers at the top of the distribution select negatively into the public sector.},
